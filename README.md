# HRBot
### Don't lose faith, Hope is here to help you find a job!

The year is 2116, technology has advanced to such a significant level that our entire lives are spent on Slack. Unemployment is on an all time high because of humanity's rather slack attitude of life.

We at RLC Labs have devised the mother of all solutions - to leave the fate of Human Resource Management in the hands of a robot. Say hello to Hope Rising, your new personal job seeking assistant and hopeful Skynet competitor.

## Why Hope Rising

To increase productivity at the sacrifice of actually looking for a job we devised a bot that searches the [Kindjobs](http://kindjobs.herokuapp.com/) database to look for a job matching your query. You can then submit your job application through Slack, which is stupid because you should actually be writing in to HR like a normal person would.

## Why Slack?

So this is actually a coding challenge and the criteria to pass is to build a simple slack chat bot.

## Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express because servers are hard to come by these days
* MongoDB for some very basic database stuff
* [Slackbots](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots)
* Axios to talk to the Kindjobs API

## API

[Kindjobs](http://kindjobs.herokuapp.com/), an initiative of [Conjunct Consulting](http://conjunctconsulting.org/) built with love by [Team CLR](https://github.com/CLR-WDI).
